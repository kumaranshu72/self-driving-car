<h1> Self Driving car </h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This project is related to building an agent to drive a car. The agent learns to drive the car by getting the rewards after geeting in various states in the enviornment. Basicially this this reinforcement or q-learning. I basically have created a artififcal neural network in which we have on input state then a hidden layer in which rectifier function is used for activation of the neuron. Then the output of the hidden layer are fed to softmax function to take the right action.
